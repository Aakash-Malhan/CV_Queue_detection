# CV_Queue_detection
This project is a computer vision solution designed to automate the process of estimating customer wait times in a Chick-fil-A queue.

This project is a computer vision solution designed to automate the process of estimating customer wait times in a Chick-fil-A queue. By analyzing a live video feed or a pre-recorded video, the system counts the number of people in the queue and, based on a fixed average service time per person, provides an estimated waiting time.

This project was developed and tested using live data from the Arizona State University (ASU) campus, demonstrating its effectiveness in a real-world environment.

Features
Real-Time Queue Detection: Counts the number of people in a designated queue area.

Wait Time Estimation: Calculates an estimated waiting time based on the queue length.

Object Detection: Utilizes the YOLOv5 model for accurate and efficient person detection.

Video Processing: Processes video frames to perform analysis and display results.
